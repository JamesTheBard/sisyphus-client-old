title: Mkvmerge Module
---

## Overview

The `mkvmerge` module is very similar to the `ffmpeg` module in that the data passed to it is very similar to the way the Mkvmerge binary requires its options.  This module does not conver the insane number of options and combinations that the `mkvmerge` binary can do, but it does cover the basics.

## Config Options

The following configuration options can be set in the `config.py` file:

- `MKVMERGE_ENABLE_FONT_ATTACHMENTS`: Enables the processing of Substation Alpha subtitle files for fonts, and attach those fonts to the resulting Matroska file.  Required.
- `MKVMERGE_FONT_DIRECTORY`: The directory of fonts which hold fonts used for subtitling.  If the subtitles file(s) are Substation Alpha files, it will scrape the styles and attach fonts to the resulting Matroska file for every style it finds.  Only required if the `MKVMERGE_ENABLE_FONT_ATTACHMENTS` configuration option is set to _True_.

## Data Format

### Sources

The `sources` are a list of input files from which tracks will be muxed into a resulting Matroska file.

### Tracks

The `tracks` section tells Mkvmerge which tracks from each source need to be muxed into the resulting Matroska file.  The options section can be used to set any option that can be used on a track-by-track section from the `mkvmerge` documentation.  For those options, just ignore the first two dashes as they are automatically generated by the module.

For the source and track relationship, the source is zero-indexed from the sources list, and the track is zero-indexed as the stream number in the aforementioned source.  Currently,

```json title="Tracks Section"
{
  "source": 1,
  "track": 2,
  "options": {
    "track-name": "Cool English Track",
    "language": "eng",
    "default-track": "yes",
    "original-track": "yes"
  }
}
```
